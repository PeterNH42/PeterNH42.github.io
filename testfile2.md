# Peter's GitHub Pages Web Site

I'll use this for some basic Markdown testing. 

Today, I'm testing the process that we'll ask potential writing candidates to perform. We'd like them to create a simple GitHub Pages site, where they can describe their experience completing a technical exercise.

## What procedure will we use?

We'll ask them to install Docker and run a simple application in Docker.
